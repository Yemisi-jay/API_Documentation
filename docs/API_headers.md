# API Headers

## 🔑 API Keys 🌍
The API authorization keys can be generated from the console once access has been granted.

| **Header**        | **Description**                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Authorization** | Bearer token supplied to you on request          |
| **Content-Type**  | Set content-type to `application/json`           |

## 📌 Other Information

**WoodCore** follows conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- **2xx** → Indicates a successful request.
- **4xx** → Indicates a client-side error due to incorrect or missing information.
- **5xx** → Indicates a server error, which is rare and usually related to WoodCore’s partners.
