# Documentation Review

#### Strengths
###### Completeness:
The documentation is comprehensive, it includes detailed descriptions of API endpoints, which is arranged logically by functionality
For each endpoint,examples of requests and responses are given which facilitates better understanding and implementation for the developers.
The most intriguing part for me is the inclusion of code snippete in several programming languages (such as cURL, Python, PHP, and JavaScript) this enhances developer usability.


###### Coherence:
The guides are organized in a logical progression, from introductory materials to advanced usage scenarios.
